## Abstract

本提案是对ERC-721标准的扩展，旨在使非同质化代币（NFT）持有人能够向NFT中写入题跋。通过允许题跋的添加，使NFT可以记录艺术品或收藏品的历史、作者、评价等信息，增强NFT的收藏属性和附加价值。

## Motivation

非同质化代币（NFT）作为数字资产的一种形式，已经在艺术、收藏和数字经济领域引起了巨大的关注。但当前的NFT标准在记录作品的历史和附加信息方面还存在一些局限性。为了进一步提升NFT的收藏属性和附加价值，以及增强观赏者对作品的理解和欣赏体验，引入题跋功能具有重要意义。
题跋来源于中国古代收藏文化。在中国古代，题跋是对于书画作品的简要评述或赞美的文字，用以说明作品的主题、风格、评价等方面的内容。
将题跋概念引入NFT，可以让NFT记录更多内容，并且这些内容是去中心化提供的，这种方式为NFT持有者提供了表达个人观点和情感的机会，也为观赏者提供了更深入的理解和欣赏NFT作品的方式。此外，题跋的存在也可以为NFT作品增加互动性和社交性。观赏者可以通过查看NFT的题跋，了解到其他人对于同一件作品的不同观点和感受，从而促进交流和讨论。

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--

  This section is optional.

  All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Test Cases

<!--
  This section is optional for non-Core EIPs.

  The Test Cases section should include expected input/output pairs, but may include a succinct set of executable tests. It should not include project build files. No new requirements may be be introduced here (meaning an implementation following only the Specification section should pass all tests here.)
  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed

## Reference Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

Needs discussion.
